Questions to ask UTU
====================

(i) A next.id is a Decentralised ID which links your handles together on chain.

A next.id DID looks like:

  0x0318a1f57d8aadf5f555f79237de6edf5775de6aea8923a540b895cd8b93e3f005

A trait looks like:

  Is real genuine person
  Is not corrupt
  I trust them

I want to endorse the next.id as having a trait:

I was thinking of storing the following in the transactionId as json:

{ 
  next.id : '0x0318a1f57d8aadf5f555f79237de6edf5775de6aea8923a540b895cd8b93e3f005'
  trait : 'I trust them'
}

My questions

(i) Is the transactionID large enough to store the above json?

(ii) Is the transactionID stored on chain or off chain?

(iii) Is this the right approach if I want to endorse with a trait?
