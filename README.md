# utu-endorse-nextid

This is a react project which implements next.id to allow users to link their different social
media accounts to a Universal Decentralised ID.

This app also integrates the UTU Trust network to allow users to endorse Universal IDs with tags.

For example you could endorse someone as being a full stack JavaScript Developer or a Vegan Chef.

This inniative makes it harder for Bots and Fake Accounts to push false narratives.  It improves
trust in both the Web 2 and Web 3 space.
